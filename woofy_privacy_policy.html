    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="lead"><strong>Woofy — Random Dog Photos</strong> ("we", "our", or "us") is published by <strong>TripleFive
        Games</strong>. We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting it. This Privacy Policy explains how we
      collect, use, and disclose information when you use the Woofy mobile application available on Huawei AppGallery
      and other platforms.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Do Not Collect</h2>
    <p>Woofy does <strong>not</strong> require registration, sign-in, or any personal information to function. We do not
      intentionally collect personal information such as your name, email address, phone number, or precise location.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Automatically Collected Technical Information</h2>
    <p>Some non-identifying technical information may be automatically collected by the app or third-party services to
      help the app run and to improve stability. Examples include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Device model and operating system version</li>
      <li>App version</li>
      <li>Anonymous crash reports and performance metrics (if you have analytics enabled)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Third-Party APIs and Content</h2>
    <p>Woofy uses public/third-party image APIs to fetch dog photos (for example, <em>Dog CEO</em> or similar services).
      These external services may log requests and record minimal technical details (such as an IP address) to deliver
      images. We do not control those services and do not receive identifying information from them. Please consult the
      third-party API providers' privacy policies for details.</p>

    <h2>4. Advertising and Analytics</h2>
    <p>If you see ads in the app (via networks such as Huawei Ads Kit or Unity Ads), those ad networks may collect
      device identifiers (for example Advertising ID) and other non-personal information to serve and personalize ads.
      You can opt out of ad personalization using your device settings where supported.</p>

    <h2>5. How We Use Information</h2>
    <p>Any technical, non-identifying information described above is used only to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Display fetched dog images inside the app;</li>
      <li>Improve app performance and stability;</li>
      <li>Troubleshoot and fix bugs.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Data Storage and Security</h2>
    <p>We do not store personal data on our servers. Data transmitted through third-party APIs or ad networks is subject
      to those providers' security practices. We take reasonable technical measures to protect any data processed by the
      app.</p>

    <h2>7. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>Woofy is designed for a general audience and does not knowingly collect personal information from children under
      13. If you believe we have inadvertently collected personal information from a child, please contact us so we can
      promptly delete it.</p>

    <h2>8. International Transfers</h2>
    <p>The app and third-party services we use may transfer and process data in countries other than your own. By using
      the app, you consent to such transfers for the limited, technical purposes described above.</p>

    <h2>9. Your Rights</h2>
    <p>Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have rights related to your personal data, such as the right to access,
      delete, or restrict processing. Because Woofy does not collect personal data by default, most of these rights will
      not apply. If you believe we hold personal data about you, contact us and we will investigate.</p>

    <h2>10. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy occasionally. If we make material changes, we will update the "Last updated"
      date at the top of this page. Your continued use of the app after changes are posted constitutes acceptance of the
      updated policy.</p>

    <h2>11. Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have questions or requests about this Privacy Policy, contact:</p>
